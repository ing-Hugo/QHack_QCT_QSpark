Loading Probability Distributions in a Quantum circuit :

Quantum circuits generating probability distributions has applications in several areas. Areas like
finance require quantum circuits that can generate distributions that mimic some given data pattern.
Hamiltonian simulations require circuits that can initialize the wave function of a physical quantum
system. These wave functions, in several cases, are identical to some very well known probability
distributions. In this paper we discuss ways to construct parameterized quantum circuits that can
generate both symmetric as well as asymmetric distributions. We follow the trajectory of quantum
states as single and two qubit operations get applied to the system, and find out the best possible
way to arrive at the desired distribution.
